# Batch API Company Info Retriever

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script that retrieves the official website and main product information for a list of companies using the Perplexity API. The script processes companies in batches, queries the API for live data, and writes the results to a CSV file.

## Features
- Queries the Perplexity API in **batches of 6** to minimize costs and improve efficiency.
- Retrieves **official website** and **main product** (or most well-known product if the main one is unavailable).
- Handles **malformed data**, **missing fields**, and other edge cases gracefully.
- Writes results to a CSV file with columns: `CompanyName`, `Website`, and `MainProduct`.
- Includes robust error handling and debugging for seamless operation.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7 or higher.
2. A Perplexity API key.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/batch-api-company-info-retriever.git cd batch-api-company-info-retriever

markdown
Copy code
2. Install required Python packages:
pip install requests

vbnet
Copy code
3. Set your Perplexity API key as an environment variable:
export PERPLEXITYAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

markdown
Copy code

## Usage
1. Prepare an input CSV file (`companies.csv`) with at least one column:
- `CompanyName`: List of company names to query.

Example:
CompanyName Google Microsoft Apple

markdown
Copy code

2. Run the script:
python main.py

markdown
Copy code

3. Output CSV (`companies_with_website_and_product.csv`) will contain:
- `CompanyName`: Original company name from input.
- `Website`: Official website of the company.
- `MainProduct`: Main or most well-known product.

## Notes
- Missing or unavailable information is filled with `N/A`.
- Errors in one API response line do not affect the rest of the batch.
- Ensure that the Perplexity API key has sufficient permissions and quota for the queries.
